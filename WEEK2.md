# Week 2 Challenge

This week we will complete the "Welcome to Louie's" and "Contact Louie" sections of this site.  As a reference,
refer to the site.pdf file included in this repo to see what the target style should look like.  

## Complete the Welcome Section

1. Find the Welcome section of the site in index.html.
2. Add a subheading (h2) with the text "WELCOME TO LOUIE'S"
3. Add the following paragraph after the subheading:```
    Enjoy the old-school ambiance, original wooden booths sentimentally etched by our loyal customers, the black and white art deco floors worn by time, turn of the century tin ceilings and faded murals tell tale of a bygone era. Sit back, relax, enjoy the smell of simmering tomatoes and hot pizza, feel the warmth and camaraderie, hear the laughter and conversation of happy diners and you feel like you are home again, somewhere familliar, comfortable, affordable, family centered and “ORIGINAL”. ```
5. Use the grid system classes `col` and `span_{columns}_of_2` to make the content take up the full width.  
6. Notice that the content doesn't line up with the existing content.  The header has a `div` with the class `wrap` which limits the width of the content.  Let's apply this to our welcome section.
7. Finally, make just the name "Louie's" in the subheading the color `#871719` (dark red).  Hint:  You can use `span` elements inside the `h2` element to apply special stying to specific text.

## Complete the Newsletter Section

1. Find the Newsletter section of the site in index.html.
2. Similar to the welcome section, add a wrapper div with the class `wrap`
